# Questions

1. What are you proud of?
Learning the basics of a new language in such a short amount of time.
1. What do you need to improve?
I need to improve my knowledge on Github/git commands, Classes, and Testing
1. What questions do you still have?
I still want to learn more on how to use pry, I feel like I did not get a full understanding of its full ability.

# Rubric

## Functionality - 2

Notes: got to the start of 3 up to?, will not work with odd number credit cards

- [ x] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics - 3

Notes:

The student(s):

- [ x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [x ] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [ ] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [ x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [ ] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design -2

Notes: I feel like my organization in the code can be much better, I need to work on my code blocks, it is not the worst though.

The student(s):

- [ ] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [ x] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [ x] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [ x] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing - 1

Notes: I have some idea of how to do this, but I do need more practice on the testing, It is the goal this weekend along with git commands.

The student(s):

- [x ] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [ ] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [ ] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [ ] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control - 

Notes: I do not feel knowledgable enough on the using the git commands on the terminal, Practicing Git and Tests this weekend.

The student(s):

- [ x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [ ] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [ ] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
